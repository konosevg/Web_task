Hi,
For implementing this QA task i used a PyCharm IDE, Python with Pytest and Selenium frameworks. 
The test already has parameterized test data inputs. 
The test selects a department by name, then count the number of available jobs and compare this value with expected number of vacancies from this department from data inputs
